Binary-Converter-2.0

Hi there. I designed the binary converter to shoot up from the start menu to where ever it was closed before.
I drew inspiration from old school mega man where he shoots down from the top of the screen.

I also wanted it to look like a command window, so I made it black. Its white outline shows where the application is so it's not lost
to the background.

It has no border and has custom drag drop system.
I'm very pleased with its outcome.
